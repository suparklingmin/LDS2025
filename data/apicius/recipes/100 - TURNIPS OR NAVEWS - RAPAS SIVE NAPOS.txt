[Turnips are] COOKED [soft, the water is] SQUEEZED [out; then] CRUSH A GOOD AMOUNT OF CUMIN AND A LITTLE RUE, ADD PARTHICAN [1] LASER OR [2] VINEGAR, STOCK, CONDENSED WINE AND OIL [3] HEAT MODERATELY AND SERVE.
-----
[1] i.e. Persian laser; List. _laser, Parthicum_; (the comma makes a difference!) Sch. _particum_--a part.
[2] Tac., Tor. _vel acetum_; List. G.-V. _mel, acetum_. Another comma; and "honey" instead of "or." V. We doubt this: the vinegar is an alternative, for it takes the place of the more expensive Persian _laser_ (which was an essence of the _laser_ root, often diluted with vinegar).
[3] List., G.-V. _oleum modice_: _fervere_; Tor. _& oleum, quæ modice fervere facias_. Again note Lister's punctuation here and in the foregoing notes. The misplaced commas and colons raise havoc with the formulæ everywhere. Torinus, who in his preface complains that his authority has no punctuation whatsoever and thereby indicates that it must have been a very ancient copy, (at least prior to the 1503 Tac. ed.) is generally not far from the mark. It is also doubtful that the variants are by him, as is claimed by List. In this instance, indeed, Tor. is again correct.
