PLACE THEM IN A PICKLE OF MUSTARD, VINEGAR, SALT AND HONEY, COVERING MEAT ENTIRELY, AND WHEN READY TO USE YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.
-----
V. Method still popular today for pickling raw meats. The originals treat of cooked meats (Tor. _nucula elixa_; G.-V. _unguellæ coctæ_; Tac. _nucella cocta_). Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and the Germans _Sauerbraten-Einlage_.
