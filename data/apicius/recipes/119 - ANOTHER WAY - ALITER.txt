BOIL THE PARSNIPS [sufficiently, if] HARD [1] [then] PUT THEM IN A SAUCE PAN AND STEW WITH OIL, STOCK, PEPPER, RAISIN WINE, STRAIN [2] AND BIND WITH ROUX.
-----
[1] Tor. _præduratos_; List. _prædurabis_. How can they be hardened? It may perhaps stand for "parboil." We agree with Tor. that the hard ones (_præduratos_) must be cooked soft.
[2] Tor. and Tac. _Colabis_--strain; List. and G.-V. _Colorabis_--color. No necessity for coloring the gravy, but straining after the binding with roux is important which proves Tor. correct again. Cf. note 1 to {Rx} No. 73 and note 2 to {Rx} No. 55.
