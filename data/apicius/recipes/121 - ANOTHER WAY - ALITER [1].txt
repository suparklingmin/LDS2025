BRUISE THE BOILED PARSNIPS [scallops, muscular part of shellfish] ELIMINATE THE HARD STRINGS; ADD BOILED SPELT AND CHOPPED HARD EGGS, STOCK AND PEPPER.

[1] V. This formula is virtually a repetition of {Rx} No. 46, all the more bewildering because of the divergence of the term (Cf. {Rx} No. 115), which stands for "scallops" or the muscular part of any bivalve, at least in the above formula.
The Græco-Latin word for cow-parsnip is _spondylium_, _sphondylium_, _spondylion_. It is almost certain that the preceding parsnips formulæ are in the right place here. They are in direct line with the other vegetables here treated--the shellfish--_spondylus_--would be out of place in this chapter, Book III, The Gardener. All the recipes, with the exception of the above, fit a vegetable like parsnips. Even Lister's and Humelberg's interpretation of the term, who read _spongioli_--mushrooms--could be questioned under this heading, Book III.
It is barely possible that this entire series of formulæ, _Spondyli uel fonduli_ ({Rx} Nos. 115-121) does belong to Book II among the scallop _hysitia_, though we are little inclined to accept this theory.
Cf. {Rx} No. 122 which appears to be a confirmation of the view expressed above.
