[1] Read: _Pandectes_--embracing the whole science.
[2] Read: _Salacaccabia_--from _salsa_ and _caccabus_--salt meat boiled in the pot. Sch. _Sala cottabia_; G.-V. _cattabia_.
[3] Sch. _casiam_ instead of _caseum_.
[4] Sch. _Copadiis porcinis_--small bits of pork; List. _cepas aridas puto_--"shallots, I believe"; Lan. _capparis_; Vat., G.-V. _id._
[5] Dann. Chicken meat.
[6] This dish if pork were added (cf. Sch. in note 4 above) would resemble our modern "headcheese"; the presence of cheese in this formula and in our word "headcheese" is perhaps not accidental; the cheese has been eliminated in the course of time from dishes of this sort while the name has remained with us. "Cheese" also appears in the German equivalent for custard--_Eierk√§se_.
