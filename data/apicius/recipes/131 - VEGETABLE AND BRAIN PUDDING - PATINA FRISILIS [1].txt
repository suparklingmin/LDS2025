[1] List. _frictilis_; Vat. Ms. _fusilis_; G.-V. _id._; Lan. _frisilis_.
_Patina frisilis_ remains unexplained. None of the various readings can be satisfactorily rendered. If the vegetables had remained whole the dish might be compared to a _chartreuse_, those delightful creations by the Carthusian monks who compelled by the strictest rules of vegetarianism evolved a number of fine vegetable dishes. On the other hand, the poached mixture of eggs and brains is akin to our _farces_ and _quenelles_; but in modern cookery we have nothing just like this _patina frisilis_.
