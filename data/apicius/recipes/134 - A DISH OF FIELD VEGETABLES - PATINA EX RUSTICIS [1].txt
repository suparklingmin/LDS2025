[2] Tor. wanting in other texts.
[3] Sch., G.-V. _tamnis_--wild wine; List. _cymis cuminis_; Lan., Tac. _tinis_; Vat. Ms. _tannis_. Thyme is hardly likely to be the chief ingredient of such a dish; the chances are it was used for flavoring and that the above enumerated vegetables were combined in one dish.
