[1] List., G.-V. 1-1/2 glass.
[2] Hot water bath.
[3] Tor. continues {Rx} No. 135 without interruption or caption, and describes the above recipe. He reads: _De thoris accipies rosas_, but List. insists that _de thoris_ be read _de rosis_; Lan., Tac. _de toris_; V. _de thoris_ may be read "fresh from the flower bed."
Cf. {Rx} Nos. 167 and 171 in which case the "rose" may stand for rosy apple, or "Roman Beauty" apple. "Rose apple" also is a small pimento, size of a plum.
