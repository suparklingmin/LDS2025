FUMIGATE A VINEGAR BARREL WITH PITCH [1], WASH IT OUT WITH VINEGAR AND STACK THE OYSTERS IN IT [2]
-----
[1] Tor. _vas ascernum_, corrected on margin, _ab aceto_. List. _vas ab aceto_, which is correct. G.-V. _lavas ab aceto_; V. the oysters? unthinkable! Besides it would do no good.
[2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt, close tight. V. Goll's authority for this version is not found in our originals.
V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in their natural habitat--salt water. Today we pack them in barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them--of no avail. The only way English oysters could have arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially constructed bottoms of the galleys.
