-----
[1] Sea-urchins, wanting in Tor.
[2] Sentence wanting in G.-V.
[3] _Pullum raptum_, in most texts; G.-V. _p. carptum_--plucked. Of course! Should _raptum_ be translated literally? A most atrocious way of killing fowl, to be sure, but anyone familiar with the habits of the ancients, particularly with those of the less educated element, should not wonder at this most bestial fashion, which was supposed to improve the flavor of the meat, a fashion which, as a matter of fact still survives in the Orient, particularly in China.
[4] Vat. Ms. _Tarentino farsos_; Tor. cooks the sausage in the ashes--_coctos in cinere_; List. _in cinere legendum jecinora_--chicken giblets. Lister's explanation of the Tarentinian sausage is found in the vocabulary, _v. Longano_.
