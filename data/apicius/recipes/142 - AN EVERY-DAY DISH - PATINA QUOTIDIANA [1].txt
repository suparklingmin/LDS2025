-----
[1] List. _cottidiana_; G.-V. _cotidiana_. Everyday Dish, in contrast to the foregoing Apician dish which is more sumptuous on account of the figpeckers or thrushes. In the originals these two formulæ are rolled into one. Cf. {Rx} No. 128.
[2] G.-V. _Hæc omnia concides_; Tor. _condies_; List. _condies lege concides_ which we dispute. _Condies_--season, flavor--is more correct in this place; _concides_--mince--is a repetition of what has been said already.
[3] Origany wanting in G.-V.
[4] List. _superficie versas in discum insuper in superficium pones_; Sch. _a superficie versas indusium super focum pones_; G.-V. _in discum_; Tor. _unum uerò laganum fistula percuties à superficie uersas in discum in superficiem præterea pones_--which we have translated literally above, as we believe Tor. to be correct in this important matter of having a chimney on top of such a pie.
