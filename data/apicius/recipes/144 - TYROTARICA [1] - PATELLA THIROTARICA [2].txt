[5] Modern fish _au gratin_ is made in a similar way. Instead of this wine sauce a spiced cream sauce and grated cheese are mixed with the bits of cooked fish, which is then baked in the dish.
Brains, chicken, etc., too, are served _au gratin_, but a combination of the three in one dish is no longer practiced. However, the Italian method of baking fish, etc., _au gratin Ã  l'Italienne_ contains even more herbs and wine reduction than the above formula.
