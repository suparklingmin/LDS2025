[1] Wanting in Tac. and Tor. G.-V. _patellam ex holisatro_.
[2] It is worth noting that Tor. and Tac. omit this recipe entirely and that Tor. concludes the preceding formula with the last sentence of the above formula, except for the difference in one word. Tor. _et de quacunque libra_ [List. _et al._ _herba_] _si volueris facies ut demonstratum est supr√†_. This might mean that it is optional (in the preceding formula) to shape the fish into one pound loaves instead of the small fish balls, which is often done in the case of forcemeats, as in veal, beef, ham loaves, or fish pie.
We are inclined to accept the reading of Torinus, for the above way of preparing "any kind of vegetables or herbs" is somewhat farfetched. Furthermore, the vegetable dish would more properly belong in Book III.
Just another example of where readings by various editors are different because of the interpretations of one word. In this case one group reads _libra_ whereas the other reads _herba_.
