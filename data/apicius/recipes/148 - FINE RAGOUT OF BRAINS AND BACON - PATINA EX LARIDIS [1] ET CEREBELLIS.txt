[1] G.-V. _lagitis_; Tor. _laridis_ and _largitis_; Vat. Ms. _lagatis_; List. _pro lagitis ... legendum Lacertis_. The _lacertus_, according to List., is a much esteemed salt fish; not identified. List. _et al._ seem to be mistaken in their reading of _lacertis_ for _laridis_. This work stands for salt pork, from _laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English _lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in general). Cf. notes to {Rx} No. 41.
[2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.
[3] _oua dura_; Sch. _o. dua_--two eggs.
[4] This formula would be intelligible and even gastronomically correct were it not for this word "fish." However, we cannot accept Lister's reading _lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The French have another term for this--_petits salés_. Both this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media pones_--put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to {Rx} No. 41.
The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a popular Continental dish, although its principal ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.
