[1] List., G.-V. _mullorum loco salsi_--salt mullet.
[2] Tor. wanting in other texts.
[3] List. _liquamen_--broth, brine, which would be worse than carrying owls to Athens. As a matter of fact, the mullet if it be what List. says, _loco salsi_--salted on the spot, i.e. as caught, near the sea shore, requires soaking to extract the salt.
