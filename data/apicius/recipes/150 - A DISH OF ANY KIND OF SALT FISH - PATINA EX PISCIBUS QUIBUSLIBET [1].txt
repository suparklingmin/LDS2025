[1] Ex Tor.; G.-V. _P. piscium loco salsi_.
[2] Tor.; sentence wanting in other texts.
[3] Tor. _duratos_--_hard_--no sense here, probably a misprint of the d. List. _curatos_--carefully treated, "cured," processed.
[4] _Salsum coctum_, cf. notes to {Rx} No. 148; Goll., Dann.--sprinkle [the fish] with salt.... Like Lister's error in the preceding formula it would be a great blunder to add salt to a cured fish already saturated with salt to the utmost. Cf. also note 2 to {Rx} Nos. 41, 148.
[5] Virtually a repetition of {Rx} No. 149, except for the addition of the pork.
