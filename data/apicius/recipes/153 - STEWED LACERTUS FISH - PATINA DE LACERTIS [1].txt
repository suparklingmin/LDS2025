[1] Ex List. wanting in Tor. G.-V. _P. de lagitis_; cf. note to {Rx} No. 148.
[2] Remembering that List. reads _lagitis_ for _lacertis_, this formula appears to be an antique "Scrambled Eggs and Bacon." Cf. notes to {Rx} Nos. 42, 148-150.
[3] _Oenogarum_, cf. {Rx} No. 147, the Sardine Omelette.
[4] To cook the eggs as described above would be disastrous. The fish, if such was used, was probably first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done, removed from the pan. The _fond_, or remaining juice or gravy, was subsequently tied with the egg yolks, and this sauce was strained over the fish dressed on the service platter, the _{oe}nogarum_ sparingly sprinkled over the finished dish. This would closely resemble our modern _au vin blanc_ fish dishes; the _{oe}nogarum_ taking the place of our meat glac√©.
Another interpretation of this vexatious formula is that if fish was used, the cooked fish was incorporated with the raw beaten eggs which were then scrambled in the pan. In that event this formula resembles closely the sardine omelette.
