[1] G.-V. _m. ex citriis_.
[2] At this late point Apicius commences to use the term _coctura_ which does not designate any particular ingredient but rather stands for a certain process of cookery, depending upon the ingredients used in the dish. We would here interpret it as the frying of the leeks in oil, etc. In another instance _coctura_ may mean our modern _r√©duction_.
[3] The fruit to be used here has not been satisfactorily identified. The texts have _citrium_ and _citrum_--a sweet squash or cucumber--perhaps even a melon, but not the citron, the _mala citrea_ as read by List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.
We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to hollow out the fruit.
The title, implying a "sweet dish" is obviously wrong.
It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the orange, both of which are indispensable to modern cookery.
