[1] List. Roses; Tor. _Rosatium_; this term, medieval Latin, does not exist in the ancient language.
Sch. _mala rosea_--rosy or red apple, most likely to be the correct interpretation. Cf. {Rx} Nos. 136 and 167.
The above title has led to the belief that the ancients made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister's work in 1705.
We concur with Schuch's interpretation that rosy apples were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for the fruit of the rose tree.
