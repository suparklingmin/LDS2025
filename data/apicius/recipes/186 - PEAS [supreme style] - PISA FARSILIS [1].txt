-----
[1] List. _Pisa farsilis_; Tor. _p. farsilia_; Tac., G.-V. _pisam farsilem_--same as _fartilis_, from _farcio_--fattened, stuffed, or crammed, or as full as it can hold, metaphorically perhaps "supreme style," "most sumptuous," etc.
[2] This meat being fat enough, the oil seems superfluous.
[3] _isicia_, formerly called Greek _hysitia_--any fine forcemeats, cut into or cooked in tiny dumplings.
[4] _Liaison_ wanting in Tor.
[5] Tor. makes no mention of the square dish and its caul lining. Caul is the abdominal membrane.
[6] _petasonis pulpas_; Dann. ham, which is not quite correct. The _petaso_ is the shoulder part of pork, either cured or fresh, generally fresh. The cooked pork shoulder here is cut into small pieces. Nothing is said about the utilization of the sow's belly mentioned at the opening of the formula. We assume that the _petaso_ can take its place in the dish.
[7] There is nothing just like this dish in the history of gastronomy, considering both the comparatively cheap materials and the refinement of the gastronomic idea which it embodies. The _chartreuses_ of CarÃªme are the nearest thing to it. Lister waxes enthusiastic about it.
