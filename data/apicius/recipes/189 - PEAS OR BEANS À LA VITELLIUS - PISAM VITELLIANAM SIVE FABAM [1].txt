-----
[1] List. _Pisa Vitelliana_--named for Vitellius, ninth Roman emperor, notorious glutton, according to Hum. who says that V. invented this dish: _ab auctore Vitellio Imperatore luxui deditissimo_. But Tor. differs; his _pisum uitellinum_ stands for peas with yolks--_vitellum_--yolk, (also calf) dim. _vitellinum_; Tac. _v----am_. Cf. {Rx} No. 193.
[2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.
[3] _lias_--to make a purée by crushing and straining. Tor. _lævigabis_, from _levigo_--meaning the same.
[4] If Vitellius never invented any other dish than this one, his gluttony was overrated. As a gastronomer he may be safely relegated to the vast multitude of ill-advised people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps pathological) causes them to accumulate a surplus of fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and his faithful court baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the last. The poor emperor's _embonpoint_ proved cumbersome when he fled the infuriated mob. Had he been leaner he might have effected a "getaway." He was dragged through the streets and murdered, Dec. 21 or 22, A.D. 69.
