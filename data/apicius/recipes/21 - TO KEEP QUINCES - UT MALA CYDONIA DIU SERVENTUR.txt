PICK OUT PERFECT QUINCES WITH STEMS [1] AND LEAVES. PLACE THEM IN A VESSEL, POUR OVER HONEY AND DEFRUTUM [2] AND YOU'LL PRESERVE THEM FOR A LONG TIME [3].
-----
[1] V. Excellent idea, for the stems, if removed, would leave a wound in the fruit for the air to penetrate and to start fermentation. Cf. also the next formula.
[2] G.-V. _defritum_, from _defervitum_; _defrutum_ is new wine, spiced, boiled down to one half of its volume.
[3] This precept would not keep the fruit very long unless protected by a closefitting cover and sterilization. Cf. No. 24.
