[In a deep dish arrange the duck] ON TOP OF THE TURNIPS [strain the sauce over it] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.
-----
[1] Duck and Turnips, a dish much esteemed on the Continent today. Only few prepare it correctly as does Old Apicius; hence it is not popular with the multitude.
[2] Tac., Tor. _excipies_; Hum. _legendum: ex rapis_.
[3] G.-V. _ut exbromari possint_; Tor. _expromi_; Hum. _expromari_; all of which does not mean anything. To cook the turnips so that they can be squeezed out (_exprimo_, from _ex_ and _premo_) is the proper thing to do from a culinary standpoint.
[4] The turnips are cooked half, the water removed, and finished with the duck, as prescribed by Apicius. It is really admirable to see how he handles these food materials in order to remove any disagreeable flavor, which may be the case both with the turnips (the small white variety) and the duck. Such careful treatment is little known nowadays even in the best kitchens. Cf. Note 2 to {Rx} No. 212.
