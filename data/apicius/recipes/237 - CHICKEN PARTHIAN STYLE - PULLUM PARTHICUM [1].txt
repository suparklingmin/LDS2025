[1] Lister is of the opinion that the _pullus Parthicus_ is a kind of chicken that came originally from Asia, Parthia being a country of Asia, the present Persia or northern India, a chicken of small size with feathers on its feet, i.e., a bantam.
[2] Pluck, singe, empty, wash, trim. The texts: _a navi_. Hum. _hoc est, à parte posteriore ventris, qui ut navis cavus & figuræ ejus non dissimile est_. Dann. takes this literally, but _navo_ (_navus_) here simply means "to perform diligently."
[3] Tor. _casei modicum_; List. _carei_--more likely than cheese.
[4] _Cumana_--an earthenware casserole, excellent for that purpose.
[5] G.-V. _laser [et] vivum_.
