COOK THE CHICKEN IN THIS STOCK: BROTH, OIL, WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS, CORIANDER, SATURY; WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, NUTS WITH 2 GLASSES OF WATER [2] AND THE JUICE OF THE CHICKEN. RETIRE THE BUNCHES OF GREENS, ADD MILK TO TASTE. THE THINGS CRUSHED IN THE MORTAR ADD TO THE CHICKEN AND COOK IT TOGETHER: THICKEN THE SAUCE WITH BEATEN WHITES OF EGG [3] AND POUR THE SAUCE OVER THE CHICKEN. THIS IS CALLED "WHITE SAUCE."
-----
[1] G.-V. _Vardanus_; Tor. _Vardamus_; Hum. _Vardanus legendum, puto, Varianus, portentuosæ luxuriæ Imperator_. Hum. thinks the dish is dedicated to emperor Varianus (?) The word may also be the adjective of Varus, Quintilius V., commander of colonial armies and glutton, under Augustus. Varus committed suicide after his defeat in the Teutoburg Forest by the Germans.
[2] G.-V. broth, own stock--_ius de suo sibi_.
[3] Strain, avoid ebullition after the eggs have been added. Most unusual _liaison_; usually the yolks are used for this purpose. The whites are consistent with the name of the sauce.
