-----
[1] Sp√§tzle, noodles, macaroni; this dish is the ancient "Chicken Tetrazzini." Dann. Chicken pie or patty.
[2] _tractum_ and _gala_, prepared with paste and milk. Cf. _tractomelitus_, from _tractum_ and _meli_, paste and honey.
[3] Cf. Note 2 to {Rx} Nos. 244 and 246.
[4] List. _minimum_; Tor. _heminam_; Sch. _eminam_. See Measures. The noodle paste should be cooked separately in the water.
[5] List. _vel carptum_, which is correct. Tor. _vel careotam_, out of place here.
[6] This sauce seems to be superfluous. Very likely it is a separate formula for a sauce of some kind.
[7] Seems superfluous, too. The noodle paste in the chicken gravy makes it sufficiently thick.
