THE CAPON IS STUFFED IN A SIMILAR WAY BUT IS COOKED WITH ALL THE BONES REMOVED [2].
-----
[1] Sch. _in capso_. May be interpreted thus: Cooked in an envelope of caul or linen, in which case it would correspond to our modern galantine of chicken.
[2] Tor. _ossibus eiectis_; Hum. _omnibus e._; i.e. all the entrails, etc., which is not correct. The bones must be removed from the capon in this case.
