PUT IN A BRAISIÃˆRE [2] AND BOIL PEPPER, SPICES, HONEY, BROTH; AND HEAT THIS WITH THE MEAT IN THE OVEN. THE NECK PIECE ITSELF, IF YOU LIKE, IS ALSO ROASTED WITH SPICES AND THE HOT GRAVY IS SIMPLY POURED OVER AT THE MOMENT OF SERVING [3].
-----
[1] A piece of meat from the neck of a food animal, beef, veal, pork; a muscular hard piece, requiring much care to make it palatable, a "pot roast."
[2] A roasting pan especially adapted for braising tough meats, with closefitting cover to hold the vapors.
[3] Tor. combines this and the foregoing formula. G.-V. _siccum calidum_, for hot gravy. Perhaps a typographical error for _succum_.
