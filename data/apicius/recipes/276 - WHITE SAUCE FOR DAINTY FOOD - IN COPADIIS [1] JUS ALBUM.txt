TAKE CUMIN, LOVAGE, RUE SEED, PLUMS FROM DAMASCUS [2] SOAK IN WINE, ADD HONEY MEAD AND VINEGAR, THYME AND ORIGANY TO TASTE [3].
-----
[1] Lacking definite description of the _copadia_ it is hard to differentiate between them and the _offel√¶_.--_Cupedia_ (Plaut. and Goll.), nice dainty dishes, from _cupiditas_, appetite, desire for dainty fare. Hence _cupedinarius_ (Terent.) and _cupediarius_ (Lamprid.) a seller or maker of dainties, a confectioner.
[2] _Damascena_; they correspond apparently to our present stewed (dried) prunes. It is inconceivable how this sauce can be white in color, but, as a condiment and if taken in small quantity, it has our full approval.
[3] G.-V. _agitabis_, i.e. stir the sauce with a whip of thyme and origany twigs. Cf. note to following.
