GRATE [scrape, peel] SOME VERY BEST FRESH APHROS [1] AND IMMERSE IN MILK. WHEN SATURATED PLACE IN THE OVEN TO HEAT BUT NOT TO DRY OUT; WHEN THOROUGHLY HOT RETIRE FROM OVEN, POUR OVER SOME HONEY, STIPPLE [the fruit] SO THAT THE HONEY MAY PENETRATE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2] AND SERVE.
-----
[1] Tor., Tac., Lan. _musteos aphros_; Vat. Ms., G.-V. _afros_; List. _apios_, i.e. celery, which is farthest from the mark. Goll. interprets this a "cider apple," reminiscent, probably, of _musteos_, which is fresh, new, young, and which has here nothing to do with cider.
_Aphros_ is not identified. Perhaps the term stood for Apricots (Old English: Aphricocks) or some other African fruit or plant; Lister's celery is to be rejected on gastronomical grounds.
The above treatment would correspond to that which is given apricots and peaches today. They are peeled, immersed in cream and sweetened with sugar. Apicius' heating of the fruit in milk is new to us; it sounds good, for it has a tendency to parboil any hard fruit, make it more digestible and reduce the fluid to a creamy consistency.
[2] The "pepper" again, as pointed out in several other places, here is some spice of agreeable taste as are used in desserts today.
