[3] Dann. calls this a cheese cake, which is a far-fetched conclusion, although standard dictionaries say that the _tyropatina_ is a kind of cheese cake. It must be borne in mind, however, that the ancient definition of "custard" is "egg cheese," probably because of the similarity in appearance and texture.
