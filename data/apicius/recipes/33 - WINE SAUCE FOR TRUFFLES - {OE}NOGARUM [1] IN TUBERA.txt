[1] Also _Elæogarum_.
V. Directions wanting whether the above ingredients are to be added to the already prepared _garum_, which see in dictionary. Gollmer gives the following direction for _garum_: Boil a _sextarium_ of anchovies and 3 _sextarii_ of good wine until it is thick _purée_. Strain this through a hair sieve and keep it in glass flask for future use. This formula, according to Goll. should have followed our No. 9; but we find no authority for it in the original.
_Oenogarum_ proper would be a _garum_ prepared with wine, but in this instance it is the broth in which the truffles were cooked that is to be flavored with the above ingredients. There is no need and no mention of _garum_ proper. Thus prepared it might turn out to be a sensible sauce for truffles in the hands of a good practitioner.
Note the etymology of the word "garum," now serving as a generic name for "sauce" which originally stood for a compound of the fish _garus_.
Cf. _Garum_ in index.
