[1] G.-V., List. _in ovi fero_; Dann. "wild eggs," i.e., the eggs of game birds, and he comes to the conclusion that game birds themselves are meant to be used in this formula, as no reference to "eggs" is made.
There can be no doubt but what this formula deals with the preparation of sheep; Torinus says expressly: _oviferum, hoc est, carnem ovis sylvestris_--the meat of sheep from the woods, mountain sheep. _Ferum_ is "wild," "game," but it also means "pregnant." For this double sense the formula may be interpreted as dealing with either wild sheep, or with pregnant sheep, or, more probably, with unborn baby lamb, which in antiquity as today is often killed principally for its skin.

[3] Mint is still associated with lamb; the above sauce appears to be merely an elaborate Roman ancestor of our modern mint sauce, served with lamb, the chief ingredients of which are mint, vinegar and sugar, served both hot and cold.
