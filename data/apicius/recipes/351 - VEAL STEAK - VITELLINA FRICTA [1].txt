[1] Evidently a beef or veal steak _sauté_. Beef did not figure very heavily on the dietary of the ancients in contrasts to present modes which make beef the most important meat, culinarily speaking. The above sauce, save for the raisins and the honey, resembles the modern _Bordelaise_, often served with beef steaks _sauté_, in contrast to the grilled steaks which are served with _maître d'hôtel_ butter.
