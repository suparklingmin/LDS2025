COOK WITH PEPPER AND BROTH, ALSO WITH VARIOUS ORDINARY BEANS [1] BROTH, PEPPER AND LASER, CUMIN, DUMPLINGS [2] AND A LITTLE OIL [3].
-----
[1] _cum faseolis_, green string beans.
[2] Tor. _imbrato_; G.-V. _inbracto_, broken bread, regular dumplings.
[3] Lamb and beans is a favorite combination, as in the French _haricot_, made with white beans, or boiled lamb with fresh string beans, quite a modern dish. Torinus omits the cumin, which is quite characteristic.
