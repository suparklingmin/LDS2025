Ex Tor. first sentence wanting in other texts.
[1] List. and G.-V. _moretaria_, from _moretum_.
[2] Dann. calls this "_Kalte Schale_" which as a rule is a drink or a cold refreshing soup, popular on the Continent in hot weather. Not a bad interpretation if instead of the broth the original called for wine or fruit juices.
V. _Mortaria_ are ingredients crushed in the mortar, ready to be used in several combinations, similar to the ground fine herbs, _remoulade_, in French cuisine that may be used for various purposes, principally for cold green sauces.
