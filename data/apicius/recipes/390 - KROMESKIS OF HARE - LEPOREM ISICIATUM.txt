THE HARE IS COOKED AND FLAVORED IN THE SAME [above] MANNER; SMALL BITS OF MEAT ARE MIXED WITH SOAKED NUTS; THIS [salpicon] [1] IS WRAPPED IN CAUL OR PARCHMENT, THE ENDS BEING CLOSED BY MEANS OF SKEWERS [and fried].
-----
[1] We call this preparation a salpicon because it closely resembles to our modern salpicons--a fine mince of meats, mushrooms, etc., although the ancient formula fails to state the binder of this mince--either eggs or a thickened sauce, or both.
