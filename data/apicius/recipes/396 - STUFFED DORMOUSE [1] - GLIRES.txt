[1] _Glis_, dormouse, a special favorite of the ancients, has nothing to do with mice. The fat dormouse of the South of Europe is the size of a rat, arboreal rodent, living in trees.
Galen, III, de Alim.; Plinius, VIII, 57/82; Varro, III, describing the _glirarium_, place where the dormouse was raised for the table.
Petronius, Cap. 31, describes another way of preparing dormouse. Nonnus, Di√¶teticon, p. 194/5, says that Fluvius Hirpinus was the first man to raise dormouse in the _glirarium_.
Dormouse, as an article of diet, should not astonish Americans who relish squirrel, opossum, muskrat, "coon," etc.
