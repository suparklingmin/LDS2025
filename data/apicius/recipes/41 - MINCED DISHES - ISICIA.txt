[1] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts. V. Forcemeats, minced meats, sausage. Tor. _Hysitia_, from _Isicia_. This term is derived from _insicium_, from _salsicium_, from _salsum insicium_, cut salt meat; old French _salcisse_, _saulcisse_, modern French _saucisse_, meaning sausage. This is a confirmation of the meaning of the word _salsum_--meaning primarily salt meat, bacon in particular. It has survived in modern French terminology in _salés_ more specially _petits salés_--small rashers of bacon. _Salsum_ has caused much confusion in some later formulæ. Cf. notes to Nos. 148, 150, 152.
