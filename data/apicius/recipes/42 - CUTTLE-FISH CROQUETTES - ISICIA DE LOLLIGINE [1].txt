V. This formula plainly calls for fish balls braised or stewed in broth. Ordinarily we would boil the fish first and then separate the meat from the bones, shred or chop it fine, bind with cream sauce, flour and eggs; some add potatoes as a binder, and fry.
[1] G.-V. _lolligine_; Tor. _loligine_, which is correctly spelled.
[2] Tac. and Tor. _in pulmento tundes_. G.-V. _fulmento_ which is wrong. _Pulmentum_, abbreviated for _pulpamentum_, from _pulpa_. It means a fleshy piece of fish or meat, a tid-bit.
[3] The original says _in liquamine fricatur_--fry in l., which is impossible in the sense of the word, frying. Either "frying" here stands for cooking, stewing, braising, poaching, or else the so mysterious _liquamen_ must here mean deep fat. Most likely these fish forcemeat balls were fried in olive oil. Cf. {Rx} No. 46.
