[1] The twelve chapters of Book IX, as shown in the beginning of the text are here increased to fourteen by G.-V., to wit, XII, _IUS IN MULLO TARICHO_ and XIII, _SALSUM SINE SALSO_, but these are more properly included in the above chapter XI, as does Tor. All of the above fish were salt, and probably were important commercial articles. The _silurus_, for instance, is best in the river Danube in the Balkans, while the red mullet, as seen in {Rx} No. 427 came from the sea of Galilee. Cf. {Rx} Nos. 144, 149.
[2] _Silurus_, probably the sly silurus, or sheatfish, in the U. S. called horn-pout--a large catfish.
[3] _Pelamis_, a tunny before it is a year old.
[4] Tunny, Tunafish.
[5] Tor. wanting in the others.
[6] Cf. note 1 to {Rx} No. 424.
