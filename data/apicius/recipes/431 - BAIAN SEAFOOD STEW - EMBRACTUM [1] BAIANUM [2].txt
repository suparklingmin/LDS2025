MINCED [poached] OYSTERS, MUSSELS [3] [or scallops] AND SEA NETTLES PUT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH TOASTED NUTS, RUE, CELERY, PEPPER, CORIANDER, CUMIN, RAISIN WINE, BROTH, REDUCED WINE AND OIL.
-----
[1] List. _emphractum_--a caudle, a stew. Seafood stews of this sort are very popular in the South of Europe, the most famous among them being the _Bouillabaisse_ of Marseilles.
[2] Bai√¶, a very popular seaside resort of the ancients located in the bay of Naples. The stew was named after the place. Horace liked the place but Seneca warned against it.
[3] Tor. _spondylos_; List. _sphondylos_--scallops. Both terms, if used in connection with the shellfish are correct. Lister in several places confuses this term with _spongiolus_--mushroom. This instance is the final vindication of Torinus, whose correctness was maintained in {Rx} Nos. 41, 47, 115, _seq._; 120, 121, 183, 309, _seq._
