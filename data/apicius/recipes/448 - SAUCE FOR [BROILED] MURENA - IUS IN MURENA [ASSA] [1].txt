[1] V. doubting that this is broiled.
[2] Tor. _Crocomagma_; List. _crocum magnum_, still used today in some fish preparations, particularly in the Bouillabaisse.
[3] The laconic style in which all these fish preparations are given, is very confusing to the uninitiated. We assume that most of these ingredients were used to season the water in which to boil fish; or, to make a _court-bouillon_, a fish-essence of the bones and the trimmings of the fish, in which to poach the sliced fish. The liquor thus gained was reduced and in the moment of serving was bound with roux or with yolks, and the fish was masked with this sauce. The exceptions from this rule are, of course, in cases where the fish was broiled or fried.
