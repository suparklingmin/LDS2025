PLACE THE MEAT IN A STEW PAN, ADD ONE POUND [2] OF BROTH, A LIKE QUANTITY OF OIL, A TRIFLE OF HONEY, AND THUS BRAISE [3].
-----
[1] Derived from _garum_ or _{oe}nogarum_, the wine sauce. These are supposed to be meat balls or cutlets prepared with garum, but the _garum_ is not mentioned in the formula. This also illustrates the interesting etymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day ancient language because it is a typical technical term, the much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find, therefore, that--at least in this instance--_garum_ no longer stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_, but that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain kinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with _lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.
[2] In this instance, and in several others, and also according to Sueton. CÃ¦s. fluids were weighed. What idea could be more practical, useful and more "modern" than this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence have thus far made futile all efforts towards more progressive methods in handling food stuffs, particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them by their weight. Present market methods are very chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of the buyer.
[3] The original: _et sic frigis_.--_Frigo_ is equivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here has taken on a broader meaning, because the "frying" process is clearly out of question here. It appears that the terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter of fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a clear definition of such terms as frying, broiling, roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to various interpretations.
