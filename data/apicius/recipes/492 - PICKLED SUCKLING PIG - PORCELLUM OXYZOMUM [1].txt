[1] _exodionum_, and in the Summary of Dishes, _exozome_, i.e. _oxyzomum_. It is curious to note the various spellings and meanings of _oxyzomum_. This is supposed to be a sour sauce or an acid preparation of some kind, yet this recipe does not mention acids. In fact, the presence of honey would make it a sweet preparation. We take it, the "garnish" contains the necessary vinegar or other acids such as lemon juice, wine, etc. _Oxyzomum_ is properly rendered "pickle."
[2] Dann. oil, occurring twice in his version.
[3] _sæpius_; Dann. confusing _sæpe_ with _cæpa_, renders this "onions sauce." The same occurs to him in XXVII.
