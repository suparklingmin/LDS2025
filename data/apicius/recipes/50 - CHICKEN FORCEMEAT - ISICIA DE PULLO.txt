[Raw] CHICKEN MEAT, 1 LB. OF DARNEL [1] MEAL, ONE QUARTER PINT OF STOCK AND ONE HALF OUNCE OF PEPPER.
-----
[1] Tor. _lolæ floris_; Hum.-List. and G.-V. _olei floris_--virgin olive oil?--first choice flour? Goll. olive (violet?) flowers; Dann. Olive oil.
The suggestion of oil is plausible because of the lack of fat in chicken meat, but the quantity--1 lb.--is out of question. Moreover, the binder would be lacking. This is found in the Torinus rendering.
His _lolæ floris_ should read _lolii_--from _lolium_--darnel rye grass or ray grass which was supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to the eye sight.--Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.
A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that of the soya bean which is not starchy.
