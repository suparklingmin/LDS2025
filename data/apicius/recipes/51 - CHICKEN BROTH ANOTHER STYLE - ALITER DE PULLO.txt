[1] V. 2 _sextarii_; Tor. _ch{oe}nicem, cenlicem_; List. _calicem_.
[2] _ch{oe}nices_?--left in doubt.
This seems to be a chicken broth, or essence for a sauce or perhaps a medicine. Torinus mentions the chicken meat, the others do not.
The original without interruption continues to describe the _isicium simplex_ which has nothing to do with the above.
