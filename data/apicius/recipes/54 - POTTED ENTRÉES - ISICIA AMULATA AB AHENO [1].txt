[2] French, for a mixture of wheat or rice flour with fats or liquids to thicken fluids. _Amylum_, or _amulum_ which hereafter will occur frequently in the original does not cover the ground as well as the French term _roux_. The quality of the "binder" depends upon the material in hand. Sometimes the fat and flour are parched, sometimes they are used raw. Sometimes the flour is diluted with water and used in that form.
[3] List. and G.-V. _sorbendum_; Tor. _subruendum_.
