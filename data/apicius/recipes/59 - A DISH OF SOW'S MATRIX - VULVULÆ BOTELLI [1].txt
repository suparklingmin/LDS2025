[1] G.-V. _Vulvulæ Botelli_; Sch. _Vulvulæ isiciata_; Tor. _De Vulvulis et botellis_. See note No. 3.
[2] V. "_Entrées_" out of respect for the ancients who used them as such; today we would class such dishes among the "_hors d'{oe}uvres chauds_."
[3] V. _Vulvula_, dim. for _vulva_, sow's matrix. Cf. _vulva_ in dictionary. Possible, also possible that _volva_ is meant--a meat roll, a croquette.
[4] V. Combinations of chopped nuts and pork still in vogue today; we use the green pistachios.
[5] V. The casings which were filled with this forcemeat may have been the sow's matrices, also caul. The original is vague on the point.
