BOTELLUM IS MADE OF [2] HARD BOILED YOLKS OF EGG [3] CHOPPED PIGNOLIA NUTS, ONION AND LEEKS, RAW GROUND PINE [4] FINE PEPPER, STUFF IN CASINGS AND COOK IN BROTH AND WINE [5].
-----
[1] V. _Botelli_, or _botuli_, are sausage of various kind; (French, Boudin, English, Pudding). Originally made of raw blood, they are in fact, miniature blood sausage. The absence of meat in the present formula makes me believe that it is not complete, though hard boiled yolk when properly seasoned and mixed with the right amount of fat, make a tasty forcemeat for sausage.
[2] Tor. _Botellum sic fades ex oui_; Sch. and G.-V. _sex ovi_--the number of eggs is immaterial.
[3] Dann. Calf's Sweetbreads.
[4] Goll. _Thus crudum_--raw blood. _Thus_ or _tus_ is either frankincense or the herb, ground-pine. Dann. Rosemary. Hum. _Thus crudum lege jus crudum_--jus or broth which would make the forcemeat soft. There is no reason for changing "_thus_" into "_jus_!"
[5] G.-V. _Adicies liquamen et vinum, et sic coques_. Tor. & _vino decoquas_.
