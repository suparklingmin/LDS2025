IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT, POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE [6].
-----
[1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.
[2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.
[3] Dann. Ventilate it. Goll. Whip the sauce in fresh air.
[4] List., G.-V. _si salsum fuerit_--if this makes it too salty--Tor. _si hoc nihil effecerit_.
[5] Tor. _novem spicam immittas_; List. _Move spica_; Goll.-Dann. stir with a whip.
[6] A classic example of Apician confusion when one interpreter reads "s" for "f" and "_novem_" for "_move_" and another reads something else. Tor. is more correct than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption. Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be discarded.
