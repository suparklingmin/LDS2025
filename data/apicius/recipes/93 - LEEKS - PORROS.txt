WELL MATURED LEEKS [1] ARE BOILED WITH A PINCH OF SALT [2] IN [combined] WATER AND OIL [3]. THEY ARE THEN STEWED IN OIL AND IN THE BEST KIND OF BROTH, AND SERVED.
-----
[1] Tor. _Poros bene maturos_; G.-V. _maturos fieri_.
[2] One of the rare instances where Apicius mentions salt in cookery, i.e., salt in a dry form. _Pugnum salis_--a fist of salt--he prescribes here. Usually it is _liquamen_--broth, brine--he uses.
[3] Tor. is correct in finishing the sentence here. G.-V. continue _et eximes._, which is the opening of the next sentence, and it makes a difference in the formula.
