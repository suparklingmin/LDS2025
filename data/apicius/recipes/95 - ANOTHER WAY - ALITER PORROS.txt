COOK THE LEEKS WITH [laurel] BERRIES [1], [and otherwise treat them] AND SERVE AS ABOVE.
-----
[1] Tor. _Porros in bacca coctos_; List. _in cacabo_--cooked in a casserole; Sch. _bafa embama_--steeped, marinated (in oil); G.-V. _in baca coctos_. Another way to read this: _baca et fab√¶_--with beans--is quite within reason. The following formula, 96, is perhaps only a variant of the above.
Brandt: with olives, referring to No. 91 as a precedent.
