-----
[1] Sentence in Tor.; wanting in List. _et al._
[2] List. No mention of beets is made in this formula; therefore, it may belong to the foregoing leek recipes. V. This is not so. Here the noun is made subject to the first verb, as is practiced frequently. Moreover, the mode of preparation fits beets nicely, except for the flour to which we object in note 3, below. To cook beets with leeks, spices and wine and serve them (cold) with oil and vinegar is indeed a method that cannot be improved upon.
[3] Tac., Tor., List., G.-V. _uvam passam_, _Farinam_--raisins and flour--for which there is no reason. Sch. _varianam_--raisin wine of the Varianian variety; Bas. _Phariam_. V. inclined to agree with Sch. and Bas.
